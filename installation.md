## Install on hosting

- Upload all files into `public_html`.
- Create a database and import data from `database.sql` (it's located in source code).
- Create `.env` from `.env.example` and update your database information.

## Install locally or in VPS

- Create `.env` file from `.env-example` and update your configuration.

- Using sample data: 
    - Import database from `database.sql`.
    
- Don't use sample data:
    - Run `composer install` to install vendor packages.
    
    - Run `php artisan migrate` to create database structure.

    - Run `php artisan cms:user:create` to create admin user.
    
    - Run `php artisan cms:theme:activate flex-home`

- If you're pulled source code from GIT server:
    - Run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=cms-public --force`
    - Run `php artisan cms:theme:assets:publish`

- Run web locally:
    - Run `php artisan serve`. Open `http://localhost:8000`, you should see the homepage.
    - Go to `/admin` to access to admin panel.
    - If you're using sample data, the default admin account is `botble` - `159357`.
    - If you don't use sample data, you need to go to Admin -> Plugins then activate all plugins.

**FlexHome should run on a virtual host. Create a virtual host like cms.local to run FlexHome. Follow these steps to see how to config virtual host: [Setup virtual host](/flex-home/master/virtualhost).**

## Note

This site can only be run at domain name, not folder link.

On your localhost, setting virtual host. Something like `http://flex-home.local` is ok.

Cannot use as `http://localhost/flex-home/...`.

Please remove `public` in your domain also, you can point your domain to `public` folder

or use `.httaccess` (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23837933/how-can-i-remove-public-index-php-in-the-url-generated-laravel)

Follow these steps to see how to config virtual host: [Setup virtual host](/flex-home/master/virtualhost).

Well done! Now, you can login to the dashboard by access to your_domain_site/admin.

    Username: botble
    Password: 159357

Enjoy!
