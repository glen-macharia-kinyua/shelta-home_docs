## Install on hosting

- Upload all files into `public_html`.
- Create a database and import data from `database.sql` (it's located in source code).
- Create `.env` from `.env.example` and update your database credentials.
- Make sure `APP_URL` in `.env` is correct your domain. It should be `APP_URL=http://your-domain.com`

## Install locally or in VPS

- Delete folder `/vendor` then run `composer install` to install vendor packages.

- Create `.env` file from `.env-example` and update your configuration.

- Using sample data: 
    - Import database from `database.sql`.
    
- Don't use sample data:
    - Run `php artisan migrate` to create database structure.

    - Run `php artisan cms:user:create` to create admin user.
    
    - Run `php artisan cms:theme:activate flex-home`

- If you're pulled source code from GIT server:
    - Run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=cms-public --force`
    - Run `php artisan cms:theme:assets:publish`

- Run web locally:
    - Change `APP_URL` in `.env` to `APP_URL=http://localhost:8000`
    - Run `php artisan serve`. Open `http://localhost:8000`, you should see the homepage.
    - Go to `/admin` to access to admin panel.
    - If you're using sample data, the default admin account is `botble` - `159357`.
    - If you don't use sample data, you need to go to Admin -> Plugins then activate all plugins.

## Setup cron job

Cron job used to renew properties automatically when it's expired. You can ignore this step if you don't need that feature.

```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```
